    "Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.\n",

    "An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "1. In other word, as long as the number of character for string s and t are the same, we can say it is a valid anagram. \n",
    "2. Use 2 map, each keep track of the number of character exist in the string s & t. \n",
    "3. Compare the map and we have the result! "
