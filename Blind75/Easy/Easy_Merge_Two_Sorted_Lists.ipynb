    "### Q3. Merge 2 sorted lists (21)\n",
    "\n",
    "https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the head of the merged linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Idea*\n",
    "1. Easiest idea would be have 2 pointer, each point to the head of the list1 and list2. Create a head of the list for return list and start to update our list.\n",
    "2. Make sure everytime we try to access the linked list node, we need to first check if the node is a None value. \n",
    "3. Process both lists until both lists are empty. "
