    "Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\n",

    "1. Use DFS to find the leave of the tree (height = 0) and their diameter will be 0. \n",
    "2. Have a map (node, diameter) to keep track of the diameter of each node from the tree. Note that the diameter = left height + right height\n",
    "3. Return the maximum map.values() => maximum diameter "
